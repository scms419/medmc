Resistance increases with degree of myelination of a nerve fibre. *Incorrect*  \nShould be decreases instead of increases.  \nThis is because myelination will increase the resistance of ion fluxes, thus the depolarizing current can flow with much less effect from K<sup>+</sup> efflux (which dissipates the depolarizing current).  \nIn fact, a new action potential can be generated at a further position from the original place for initiation of action potential, hence the velocity of action potential travels faster (lower resistance).  \n\nC.
